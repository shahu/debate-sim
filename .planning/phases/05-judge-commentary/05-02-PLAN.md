<objective>
Create the UI components for displaying judge commentary with visual score representations. This plan implements the side-by-side speaker panels with progress bars for scores and narrative feedback sections as specified in the context.

Purpose: Provide visual interface for post-debate scoring and feedback
Output: Judge scorecard UI with progress bars and feedback panels

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add Progress Component</name>
  <files>src/components/ui/progress.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the shadcn/ui Progress component as identified in research. Implementation should follow the accessible pattern from the research document with Radix UI primitives. Include proper ARIA attributes for accessibility. The component should accept a value prop (0-100) and render a visual progress indicator. Style should match the existing Tailwind CSS theme of the application. Include proper TypeScript typing for the component props.
</action>
  <verify>Verify component renders correctly with different values in a test environment</verify>
  <done>Accessible Progress component exists and can display percentage values visually</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create Judge Scorecard Component</name>
  <files>src/components/judge/JudgeScorecard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the main judge commentary display component with:
- Responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 for side-by-side panels
- Four panels (one for each speaker: PM, LO, MO, PW) arranged horizontally on larger screens
- Progress bars for each of the 5 evaluation criteria using the Progress component
- Numeric percentage display alongside each progress bar
- Narrative feedback section with strengths and weaknesses
- Specific examples from the debate included in feedback
- Winner declaration banner at top of component
- Rank ordering showing 1st-4th place with tie handling
- Color-coded speaker identification matching existing UI patterns
- Responsive design that stacks vertically on mobile
- Proper TypeScript typing using JudgeScore and JudgeFeedback types
</action>
  <verify>Component renders with mock data and displays all required information</verify>
  <done>Side-by-side judge scorecard displays scores and feedback for all four speakers</done>
