## Cross-Phase Integration Verification

All phases have been successfully integrated with no cross-phase gaps identified:

1. **Core → UI Integration:** Core mechanics properly exposed through UI components
2. **UI → Streaming Integration:** Streaming text properly displayed in UI
3. **Streaming → Audio Integration:** Text and audio synchronized for natural feel
4. **Audio → Feedback Integration:** Audio controls work with judge feedback system
5. **End-to-End Flow:** Complete debate flow from motion input to post-debate evaluation

## End-to-End User Flows

All major user flows have been verified:

1. **Debate Creation Flow:** Motion input → Speaker roles → Timer setup → Debate start
2. **Debate Execution Flow:** PM → LO → MO → PW turns with proper timing and rules
3. **POI Interaction Flow:** POI requests → Validation → Acceptance/rejection → Integration
4. **Streaming Display Flow:** AI generation → Real-time text streaming → UI display
5. **Audio Playback Flow:** Streaming text → TTS synthesis → Role-based voices → Audio controls
6. **Post-Debate Flow:** Debate completion → Judge evaluation → Scoring → Commentary display

## Technical Architecture Verification

- **Frontend Stack:** React 18.2, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Stack:** Python FastAPI, DeepSeek streaming, TTS (pyttsx3/ElevenLabs)
- **State Management:** Zustand stores for debate state, audio state, and streaming
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui with custom debate-specific components
- **Audio System:** Web Audio API with GainNode for smooth volume transitions
- **AI Integration:** Fire-and-forget streaming architecture with proper cleanup

## Quality Assurance
