# STATE: CPDL Debate Simulator

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Competitive debaters can practice realistic CPDL debates against AI opponents that strictly follow debate rules and provide sophisticated feedback, enabling them to improve their argumentation, rebuttal, and POI handling skills in a controlled environment.

**Current Focus:** Phase 2 - UI Experience - creating visual representation of the debate

## Current Position

**Current Phase:** 2 of 5 (UI Experience)
**Plan:** Not started
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Last activity:** 2026-01-29 - Phase 1 verified and complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made
- Phased development approach with 5 phases
- Starting with core mechanics to establish foundation
- Technology stack: React/Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, Vercel AI SDK

### Todos
- Begin implementation of Phase 1: Core Mechanics
- Implement debate motion input (MECH-01)
- Implement CPDL format enforcement (MECH-02)
- Implement timing enforcement (MECH-03)
- Implement role-specific rules (MECH-04)
- Implement POI mechanism (MECH-05)
- Implement turn synchronization (MECH-06)
- Implement AI agents for each role (AIAG-01 to AIAG-05)

### Blockers
- None identified yet

### Dependencies
- Third-party AI API access for DeepSeekV3
- Web Speech API for TTS functionality
