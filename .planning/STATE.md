# STATE: CPDL Debate Simulator

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Competitive debaters can practice realistic CPDL debates against AI opponents that strictly follow debate rules and provide sophisticated feedback, enabling them to improve their argumentation, rebuttal, and POI handling skills in a controlled environment.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 - Core Mechanics - establishing debate mechanics and AI agents

## Current Position

**Current Phase:** 1
**Current Plan:** Core Mechanics
**Status:** Initialized
**Progress:** 0%

## Performance Metrics

- **Phases:** 5 total
- **Requirements:** 25 v1 requirements
- **Velocity:** N/A (just started)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made
- Phased development approach with 5 phases
- Starting with core mechanics to establish foundation
- Technology stack: React/Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, Vercel AI SDK

### Todos
- Begin implementation of Phase 1: Core Mechanics
- Implement debate motion input (MECH-01)
- Implement CPDL format enforcement (MECH-02)
- Implement timing enforcement (MECH-03)
- Implement role-specific rules (MECH-04)
- Implement POI mechanism (MECH-05)
- Implement turn synchronization (MECH-06)
- Implement AI agents for each role (AIAG-01 to AIAG-05)

### Blockers
- None identified yet

### Dependencies
- Third-party AI API access for DeepSeekV3
- Web Speech API for TTS functionality

## Session Continuity

This project state captures the current position in the CPDL Debate Simulator development. The next action should be to begin implementation of Phase 1 requirements, starting with the core debate mechanics.
